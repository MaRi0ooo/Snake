A simple **classic Snake Game**, built with **C# and WPF**.  
Your goal is to control the snake, eat apples 🍎, and grow as long as possible without crashing into walls or yourself!

---

## 🎮 Gameplay
- 🟩 The snake moves across the board.
- 🍎 Apples appear randomly on the field.
- 📈 Each apple increases your score and the snake’s length.
- 💀 Hitting the wall or the snake’s own body ends the game.
